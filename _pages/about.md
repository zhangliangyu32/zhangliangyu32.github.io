About me
------
I am a final-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at Peking University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhihua Zhang](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/zhzhang/). 
Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Peking University in July, 2019.

My research interests include reinforcement learning theory and distributionally robust optimization.
