I am an assistant professor at the School of Statistics and Management at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE). 
I obtained my Ph.D. in Statistics at Peking University. 
I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhihua Zhang](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/zhzhang/). 
Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Peking University in July, 2019.

My research interests include reinforcement learning theory and distributionally robust optimization.
